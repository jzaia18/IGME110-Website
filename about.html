          This website aims to inform common users (specifically gamers) of the modern Linux options available to satisfy their needs. For a very long time, Microsoft's Windows has dominated the gaming market despite users' quarrells with the Operating System (think of how many times Windows forced you to reboot for some update while you were in the middle of doing something). Recently, there has been a strong push towards Linux Gaming by Valve, via <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/05/valve-steam-machines-linux-steamos/"> SteamOS </a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/08/22/valve-changes-everything-windows-exclusive-games-now-run-on-steam-for-linux/#568909fbe3fa">Proton</a>, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/"> personal endorsement on their download page</a>. Steam is leading the charge in what might be a new trend in gaming entirely: gaming on Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Linux distributions have been hard at work making Linux much more user friendly for everyone. The install processes has become <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/192462/linux-was-once-hard-to-install-and-use-now-its-easy/"> significantly easier and less technical</a>, and some versions of Linux, <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#0">such as Ubuntu</a>, provide clean easy instructions (and an automatic installer) that allow almost anyone to install Linux hassle-free. Finally, there has been a shift to make some versions of Linux much more GUI based. No need for complex commands entered in something that looks like it came from an 80s hacker movie, just a Desktop, icons, and menus, like most people are used to. This comes at no cost to the several advantages Linux has over Windows or OSX, such as better security, anonimity, and freedom to expand your operating system if you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source"> open source software </a> is something most users are not familiar with, or may not understand. This website hopes to not only educate people on what "open source" means, but <a href="https://publiccode.eu/"> why it's important</a> as well. This goal overlaps with Linux in a great way; almost all Linux distributions are 100% open source. Conversely, Windows and OSX are both closed source operating systems that show no signs of becomming open source any time soon. You wouldn't eat food without nutrition facts on it, so don't do the same with your operating system. Give Linux a try today.
        </p>
        <p> Enjoy~ </p>
